/* Fit the data (x_i, y_i) to the linear relationship 

   Y = c0 + c1 x

   returning, 

   c0, c1  --  coefficients
   cov00, cov01, cov11  --  variance-covariance matrix of c0 and c1,
   sumsq   --   sum of squares of residuals 

   This fit can be used in the case where the errors for the data are
   uknown, but assumed equal for all points. The resulting
   variance-covariance matrix estimates the error in the coefficients
   from the observed variance of the points around the best fit line.
